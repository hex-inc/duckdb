## Some simple scripts to build and deploy to the Hex internal PyPI index for this fork

### Prerequisites

This assumes you already have built wheels for the version you want to deploy. This should be handled by the GitHub actions on this repo but talk to @dylanscott or @TimNonet if you need help with this.

### Steps

1. Copy the wheels you've built (there should be separate artifact zips for the Linux and OSX wheels) into the wheelhouse directory.
  a. It doesn't matter if you don't have the previous forked wheels in there. We keep a versioned `packages` file in here that we add to to make sure the index doesn't lose track of old versions.
2. Poetry install and run `build_index.sh` from this directory. It should copy the wheels to a `sync` directory and render a new `index.html` there in the format pip needs
3. `assumerole` to the "global" role (which owns the hex-internal-pypi-index bucket) and run `deploy.sh`. This will copy the contents of the `sync` folder to S3
4. Commit the changes to the `packages` file
